MyHabit - Habit Tracker App
===========================

Why Another Habit Tracker?
--------------------------

After testing out numerous habit tracking apps, I realized something... None of them really hit the mark for me. Some were too complex, others lacked the features I wanted, and a few just felt too overwhelming. So, instead of settling for less, I decided to build **MyHabit**, the habit tracker that actually fits my needs!

Features
--------

*   **Customizable Habits**: Create, track, and manage your habits with ease.
    
*   **Simple UI**: Clean and minimalist design to keep things focused (definitely not because I'm not a designer ðŸ˜…).
    
*   **Progress Tracking**: Visualize your streaks and progress over time.
    
*   **Reminders**: Set notifications to keep you on track.
    
*   **Statistics**: Track success rates and view habit insights.

I'm not a designer, so if you find the UI a little _too_ simple, just remember: itâ€™s the features that matter, right? ðŸ˜œ
